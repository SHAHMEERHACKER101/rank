# NexusRank Pro - Deployment Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Service Worker redirect errors** - Fixed by adding `redirect: 'follow'` to all fetch requests
2. **Worker API key access** - Enhanced environment variable detection
3. **CORS configuration** - Updated for proper domain handling
4. **Compatibility date** - Updated to working date for free plan

## Immediate Steps to Fix:

### Step 1: Update Your Repository
1. Replace all files in your GitHub repository with the updated versions
2. Commit and push the changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Service Worker redirects and Worker API access"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Redeploy Worker
Your worker will automatically redeploy from GitHub. If it doesn't:
1. Go to Cloudflare Workers dashboard
2. Find "nexusrank-ai-pro" worker
3. Go to Settings → Triggers → Click "Deploy"

### Step 3: Verify API Key
1. Go to Cloudflare Workers dashboard
2. Select "nexusrank-ai-pro" worker
3. Settings → Variables and Secrets
4. Ensure "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY" is listed as a secret
5. If not, add it manually

### Step 4: Test Everything
After deployment, test:
```bash
# Health check (should show hasApiKey: true)
curl https://nexusrank-ai-pro.shahshameer383.workers.dev/health

# AI test
curl -X POST https://nexusrank-ai-pro.shahshameer383.workers.dev/ai/humanize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Test message"}'
```

## What's Fixed:

### Service Worker (sw.js)
- Added `redirect: 'follow'` to all fetch requests
- Prevents "redirected response was used for a request whose redirect mode is not follow" errors
- Fixes page navigation issues

### Worker (backend/worker.js)

- Better debug logging to identify configuration issues
- Updated CORS for your specific domains
- Health endpoint now shows API key status

### Configuration (backend/wrangler.jsonc)
- Removed paid-plan features causing deployment failures
- Updated compatibility date to working version
- Simplified for free plan compatibility
